In this project we will implement the interfaces.
There are five classes which we will use in order to implement the interfaces.
(We will elaborate each class by it's section)


**_functions implementations_**

**_NodeData class function:_**

The first class is called "NodeData Class".
This class represents the individual Vertex in a (directional) weighted graph,
by implementing the interface "node_data" in the code "NodeData".

In this class we will perform the following steps:

    /**
     * constructor for NodeData to create new Node with uniq key and location.
     * @param key
     * @return none return
     */
public NodeData(int key);

    /**
     * constructor for NodeData to create a copy of another node_data.
     * @param node_data n
     * @return none return
     */
public NodeData(node_data n);

  	/**
	 * Returns the key (id) associated with this node.
	 * @return
	 */
public int getKey();
	
	/** Returns the location of this node, if
	 * none return null.
	 * 
	 * @return
	 */
public geo_location getLocation();

	/** Allows changing this node's location.
	 * @param p - new new location  (position) of this node.
	 */
public void setLocation(geo_location p);

	/**
	 * Returns the weight associated with this node.
	 * @return
	 */
public double getWeight();
	
	/**
	 * Allows changing this node's weight.
	 * @param w - the new weight
	 */
public void setWeight(double w);
	
	/**
	 * Returns the remark (meta data) associated with this node.
	 * @return
	 */
public String getInfo();
	
	/**
	 * Allows changing the remark (meta data) associated with this node.
	 * @param s
	 */
public void setInfo(String s);
	
	/**
	 * Temporal data (aka color: e,g, white, gray, black) 
	 * which can be used be algorithms 
	 * @return
	 */
public int getTag();
	
	/** 
	 * Allows setting the "tag" value for temporal marking an node - common
	 * practice for marking by algorithms.
	 * @param t - the new value of the tag
	 */
public void setTag(int t);


**_DWGraph_DS classs function:_**


The second class is called "DWGraph_DS Class".
This class represents all Vertexes which are what make our graph.
This graph is called "directed weighted Graph".
This class creates a graph from each individual vertex (node) by implement the interface "directed_weighted_graph"
in the code "DWGraph_DS" to create the graph itself.
The Data Structures which I used is "HashMap" since it is very effective.
In this class we will perform the following steps:


    /**
     * constructor for DWGraph_DS to create new empty hashMap for the graph.
     * @return none return
     */
 public DWGraph_DS()


    /**
     * constructor for DWGraph_DS to create a copy to directed_weighted_graph
     * @param g directed_weighted_graph
     * @return none return
     */
public DWGraph_DS(directed_weighted_graph g);


 	 /**
	 * returns the node_data by the node_id,
	 * @param key - the node_id
	 * @return the node_data by the node_id, null if none.
	 */
public node_data getNode(int key);
	
	/**
	 * returns the data of the edge (src,dest), null if none.
	 * @param src
	 * @param dest
	 * @return
	 */
public edge_data getEdge(int src, int dest);
	
	/**
	 * adds a new node to the graph with the given node_data.
	 * @param n
	 */
public void addNode(node_data n);

	/**
 	* Connects an edge with weight w between node src to node dest.
 	* * Note: this method should run in O(1) time.
 	* @param src - the source of the edge.
	* @param dest - the destination of the edge.
 	* @param w - positive weight representing the cost (aka time, price, etc) between src-->dest.
 	*/
public void connect(int src, int dest, double w);
	
	/**
	 * This method returns a pointer (shallow copy) for the
	 * collection representing all the nodes in the graph. 
	 * @return Collection<node_data>
	 */
public Collection<node_data> getV();
	
	/**
	 * This method returns a pointer (shallow copy) for the
	 * collection representing all the edges getting out of 
	 * the given node (all the edges starting (source) at the given node). 
	 * Note: this method should run in O(k) time, k being the collection size.
	 * @return Collection<edge_data>
	 */
public Collection<edge_data> getE(int node_id);
	
	/**
	 * Deletes the node (with the given ID) from the graph -
	 * and removes all edges which starts or ends at this node.
	 * This method should run in O(k), V.degree=k, as all the edges should be removed.
	 * @return the data of the removed node (null if none). 
	 * @param key
	 */
public node_data removeNode(int key);
	
	/**
	 * Deletes the edge from the graph,
	 * @param src
	 * @param dest
	 * @return the data of the removed edge (null if none).
	 */
public edge_data removeEdge(int src, int dest);
	
	/** Returns the number of vertices (nodes) in the graph.
	 * @return
	 */
public int nodeSize();
	
	/** 
	 * Returns the number of edges (assume directional graph).
	 * @return
	 */
public int edgeSize();

	/**
 	* Returns the Mode Count - for testing changes in the graph.
 	* @return
	 */
public int getMC();



**_DWGraph_Algo class function:_**

The third class is called "DWGraph_Algo Class".
This class executes algorithmic operations on graphs which were created by "DWGraphs_DS".
We implement the interface "dw_graph_algorithms" in the code "DWGraph_Algo" to perform algorithmic operations on different graphs.
In this class we will use the parameters "Tag, weight and Info" which we have in the interface "node_data" which is used in the code "NodeData".
In this class we will perform the following steps:


  
     /**
     * Init the graph on which this set of algorithms operates on.
     * @param g
     */
public void init(directed_weighted_graph g);

    /**
     * Return the underlying graph of which this class works.
     * @return
     */
public directed_weighted_graph getGraph();

    /**
     * Compute a deep copy of this weighted graph.
     * @return
     */
public directed_weighted_graph copy();

    /**
     * Returns true if and only if (iff) there is a valid path from each node to each
     * other node. NOTE: assume directional graph (all n*(n-1) ordered pairs).
     * @return
     */
public boolean isConnected();

    /**
     * returns the length of the shortest path between src to dest
     * Note: if no such path --> returns -1
     * @param src - start node
     * @param dest - end (target) node
     * @return
     */
public double shortestPathDist(int src, int dest);

    /**
     * returns the the shortest path between src to dest - as an ordered List of nodes:
     * src--> n1-->n2-->...dest
     * Note if no such path --> returns null;
     * @param src - start node
     * @param dest - end (target) node
     * @return
     */
public List<node_data> shortestPath(int src, int dest);

    /**
     * Saves this weighted (directed) graph to the given
     * file name - in JSON format
     * @param file - the file name (may include a relative path).
     * @return true - iff the file was successfully saved
     */
public boolean save(String file);

    /**
     * This method load a graph to this graph algorithm.
     * if the file was successfully loaded - the underlying graph
     * of this class will be changed (to the loaded one), in case the
     * graph was not loaded the original graph should remain "as is".
     * @param file - file name of JSON file
     * @return true - iff the graph was successfully loaded.
     */
public boolean load(String file);

**_GeoLocation class function:_**

The fourth class is called "GeoLocation Class".
This class represents a geo location <x,y,z>, aka Point3D
In this class we will perform the following steps:


    /**
     * constructor for GeoLocation to create new GeoLocation.
     * @return none return
     */
public GeoLocation(geo_location geo);

    /**
     * copy constructor for GeoLocation to create new GeoLocation copy.
     *@param geo_location geo 
     *@return none return
     */
public GeoLocation(geo_location geo);

    /**
    *returns the values of x, y, z.
    */
public double x();
public double y();
public double z();
    
    /**
    *return the distance from geo_location g
    *@param geo_location g
    *@return the distance from geo_location g.
    */
public double distance(geo_location g);

 
**_EdgeData class function:_**
The fifth class is called "EdgeData Class".


This class represents the set of operations applicable on a 
directional edge(src,dest) in a (directional) weighted graph.
In this class we will perform the following steps:


	/**
	* constructor for EdgeData to create new Edge for the graph.
	* @return none return
	*/
public EdgeData(int src, int dest, double w) {

	/**
	 * The id of the source node of this edge.
	 * @return
	 */
public int getSrc();

	/**
	 * The id of the destination node of this edge
	 * @return
	 */
public int getDest();

	/**
	 * @return the weight of this edge (positive value).
	 */
public double getWeight();

	/**
	 * Returns the remark (meta data) associated with this edge.
	 * @return
	 */
public String getInfo();

	/**
	 * Allows changing the remark (meta data) associated with this edge.
	 * @param s
	 */
public void setInfo(String s);

	/**
	 * Temporal data (aka color: e,g, white, gray, black) 
	 * which can be used be algorithms 
	 * @return
	 */
public int getTag();

	/** 
	 * This method allows setting the "tag" value for temporal marking an edge - common
	 * practice for marking by algorithms.
	 * @param t - the new value of the tag
	 */
public void setTag(int t);
